    Parameters:
    -----------
    text: str. Sentence of text.

    -----------
    Python list of str. Words in the sentence `text`.

    This method is pre-filled for you (shouldn't require modification).

    word_freq: Python dictionary. Maps words (keys) to their counts (values) across the dataset.

    - Descend into the dataset base directory -> class folders -> individual emails.
    - Read each email file as a string.
    - Use the `tokenize_words` function above to chunk it into a list of words.
    - Update the counts of each word in the dictionary.

    Hints:
    - Check out Python functions in the os and os.path modules for walking the directory structure.
